## My Reflection

After the previous challenge, I found that there were some simple but important CSS rules that I wasn't really familiar with. :sweat_smile:

So I went through the basics again, and this time doing the challenge was smoother! :grin:

I've never tried Grid as layout before, so I used Grid instead of Flexbox in this challenge.

- **Flexbox**
  - **justify-content**/**align-content**
  - **align-items**
  - **align-self**: attribute in flex items
- **Grid**
  - **justify-content**/**align-content**: The position of the whole Grid template.
  - **justify-items**/**align-items**: The position of the grid items in the Grid template.
  - **justify-self**/**align-self**: attribute in grid items
