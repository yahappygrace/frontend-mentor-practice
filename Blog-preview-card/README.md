## My Reflection

After the previous challenge, I found that there were some simple but important CSS rules that I wasn't really familiar with. :sweat_smile:
So I went through the basics again, and this time doing the challenge was smoother! :grin:

I've never tried Grid as layout before, so I used Grid instead of Flexbox in this challenge.

- **Flexbox**
  - **justify-content**/**align-content**: The position of the entire flex container.
  - **align-items**: The position of the flex items within the flex container.
  - **align-self**: attribute in flex items.
- **Grid**
  - **justify-content**/**align-content**: The position of the entire grid template within the grid container.
  - **justify-items**/**align-items**: The position of the grid items within their respective grid cells in the grid template.
  - **justify-self**/**align-self**: attribute in grid items.

## Community Feedback Summary

There's not too much feedback on my challenge, so I tried to give a longer feedback while doing the peer review.

Reviewing others' code is harder than I thought, but I gained a lot along the way! (Thanks again to those who helped me with my code :joy:)
